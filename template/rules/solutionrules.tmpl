        <h2>Writeup Submission Rules</h2>
        <p>It is important to think of these more as walkthroughs than simple solution submissions. Essentially, another user should be able to open your writeup and understand how you got there.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Writeups should include text, doc or docx, md, pdf, etc. files detailing how you solved the crackme. Writeups can contain an executable file but should not exclusively contain an executable file.</li>
            <li>Writeups should not be compressed with a password. Our server handles the compression and passwords. Compressing is okay if you want to submit multiple files, but do not make it password-protected.</li>
            <li>Writeups should contain more than just a flag, password, serial, binary, etc. They should contain detailed information about how you got to a writeup.</li>
            <li>Check the writeup to ensure it adequately solves the crackme. For example, if a crackme requests a keygen and you submit a detailed writeup and executable that serves as the keygen, please ensure the keygen produces valid keys.</li>
            <li>While external links to blog posts or websites are allowed, we would prefer if most of the writeup information was self-contained. If you'd like to copy and paste some of the stuff from your blog/website into your writeup and leave a link back to your blog/website, you are more than welcome to do so.</li>
            <li>Be careful to read the rules for any given crackme. Unless otherwise stated or patching is necessary (patchme), assume that a crackme does not allow patching. Some allow patching, and others do not. If patching is permitted, please do not exclusively upload a patched binary. We would still like information on where and why you patched the binary. If patching is not allowed and your writeup is a patched executable, we will reject the writeup. </li>
            <li>Because this is an English-speaking site and user base, we request that all writeups be written in English, even if you have to use Google Translate. We do not and will not shame anyone for their level of English.</li>
            <li>There is room for interpretation on the level of detail required by a writeup based on the difficulty of the crackme. E.g., A 1.0 difficulty crackme with a password, key, serial, etc., in plaintext will require less information to be accepted than a 6.0 difficulty crackeme that uses anti-debugging, virtualization, custom packer, etc. So please provide a level of detail befitting the difficulty of the crackme. Even in the easy crackmes your thought process is still valuable, so we would like to see it.</li>
        </ol>
